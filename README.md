# Heart Disease Prediction System
Globally, 12 million people die each year from heart illnesses, according to the World Health Organization. 
Due to Cardiovascular illnesses about 50 percent of deaths happen in the US alone and other wealthy nations. 
Patients with such disease might be aided by the early prognosis of cardiovascular illnesses, which in turn 
can lessen the problems. The existence or absence of locomotor problems, heart diseases, and other conditions 
can all be predicted with great accuracy with machine learning techniques. With the prior prediction of disease, 
a doctor can make substantial adjustments to their diagnosis and course of therapy if such information is anticipated 
well in advance. The proposed system aims to identify the most important heart disease risk variables with the help of 
Logistic Regression algorithm and it estimates the overall risk. The dataset is pre processed into training and test datasets. 
Logistic regression, one of the key concepts of Machine Learning algorithm processes the input data and produces the accurate output. 
This system will predict the heart disease prior and thus helps people to avert the extremity of it. Machine Learning algorithm used 
in this project is Logistic Regression, as it is a classification model.
